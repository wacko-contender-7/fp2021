Repository for the Forskerpraktik poster made in 2021
Forskerpraktik 2021 is a project to explore the ethics of AI and Machine Learning together with high school students.
This poster uses p5.js and ml5.js to create a poster based on a consciously biased model created by the students using the amazing Teachable Machine system.
The javascript code is commented so novice programmers can read what is going on.
Written on VS Code using Sam Lavigne's p5.vscode plugin, and drawing on the incredible work done by the p5 and ml5 communities.
